This **Personal Finance Dashboard** project is designed to help individuals effectively manage their finances by tracking income, expenses, investments, loan repayments, and savings goals. Built using Streamlit for the front-end interface, Pandas for data handling, and Matplotlib for visualizations, this dashboard provides a user-friendly tool for financial management.

### Key Features:
1. **Income Tracking**: Users can input their monthly salary, annual bonus, interest from investments, dividend income, other sources of income (such as rent or professional fees), and cash in hand. The dashboard automatically calculates the total monthly and annual income based on these inputs.
  
2. **Expense Management**: This section allows users to input their monthly expenses across different categories, such as housing, utilities, medical, education, and entertainment. The expenses are organized into collapsible sections for easier navigation and understanding.

3. **Investments Overview**: Users can enter monthly investments in mutual fund SIPs, life insurance premiums, equity/stocks, and crypto. The dashboard calculates the total monthly investments and provides financial recommendations based on the userâ€™s investment inputs.

4. **Loan Repayments**: Users can track their monthly loan repayments, including home, personal, property, car, and other loans. This section helps individuals monitor their debt and prioritize repayments.

5. **Savings Goals**: Users can set their savings goals and track their progress. The dashboard calculates the available savings based on income, expenses, investments, and loan repayments. It shows the percentage of progress towards the savings goal.

6. **Financial Tips**: Based on user inputs, the dashboard provides personalized financial tips, such as suggestions for reducing expenses, increasing investments, or paying off loans to improve financial health.

7. **Expense Breakdown Visualization**: A pie chart visualizes the breakdown of income, expenses, savings, investments, and loan repayments, helping users quickly understand their financial situation.

8. **Export Data**: The dashboard allows users to download a CSV file summarizing their financial data.

This project is an excellent tool for personal finance management, helping users make informed decisions to achieve their financial goals.
